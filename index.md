title: Walker Pett

My name is Walker, but most people call me Will for some reason.
Here is my [CV](assets/cv.pdf).

My research interests include organellar genome evolution, deep metazoan phylogeny, statistical models of macroevolution, and Bayesian phylogenetics methods.
For the last few years, I have been developing macroevolutionary methods in [RevBayes](revbayes.com) as a postdoc in [Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.org/)'s lab at Iowa State University, where in 2014 I 
also received my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology studying animal mtDNA 
with [Dennis Lavrov](https://sites.google.com/site/dennislavrov).
In between, I spent some time as a postdoc working on deep metazoan relationships with 
[Nicolas Lartillot](http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/People/lartillot/www/index.htm) at 
the Laboratoire de Biom&eacute;trie et Biologie &Eacute;volutive in Lyon, France.

I am also a [musician](https://www.instagram.com/bittercanyon/) and a [piano tuner](http://www.walkertuner.com).
