My name is Walker, but most people call me Will for some reason.

My research interests include animal phylogeny, 
models of genome evolution, and Bayesian phylogenetics methods using MCMC.
I am currently a postdoc in [Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.org/)'s lab at Iowa State University, where in 2014 I 
also received my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology studying animal mtDNA 
with [Dennis Lavrov](https://sites.google.com/site/dennislavrov). 
In between, I spent some time as a postdoc with 
[Nicolas Lartillot](http://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/People/lartillot/www/index.htm) at 
the Laboratoire de Biom&eacute;trie et Biologie &Eacute;volutive in Lyon, France.

I am also a musician and a [piano tuner](http://www.walkertuner.com).
